# paddlepoints
A WebVr Paddle Ball Experience

PaddlePoints is a WebVR experience created in Unity for WebGL/HTML5.

https://eyegautdis.github.io/paddlepoints

The after grabbing the paddle and touching the Start button, randomly selected Blue or Red balls will fire at the player.
There are 1 and 3 point goals corresponding to the color of the ball. Hitting a ball into the incorrect goal or out-of-bounds will result in a deduction of points instead of a gain.

The round lasts 60 seconds and the score (above the player) will keep track of your Best score until the game is fully reloaded.

This is my first ever project in Unity as well as my first ever game. I muddled my way through so I could learn a bit.
There are some bugs and inefficiencies in my code but a Zip of the unity project will be made available for download anyway.

The paddle was from the Unity Asset Store by "TheCloudCreator"
The base for the project was from https://github.com/mozilla/unity-webvr-export

This game has only been tested with an Oculus Quest. It runs via Quest Link and Firefox but doesn't run correctly when using the native Quest Browser (I will look into this but your results may vary.) Even with the Quest Link, the latest drivers seem to have broken all audio.

More information will be available as the project progresses.

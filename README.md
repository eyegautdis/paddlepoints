A WebVr Paddle Ball Experience

PaddlePoints is a WebVR experience created in Unity for WebGL/HTML5.

The after grabbing the paddle and touching the Start button, randomly selected Blue or Red balls will fire at the player.
There are 1 and 3 point goals corrisponding to the color of the ball. Hitting a ball into the incorrect goal or out-of-bounds will result in a deduction of points.

The round lasts 60 seconds and the score (above the player) will keep track of your Best score.

This is my first ever project in Unity as well as my first ever game (go easy).
There are some bugs and inefficiencies in my code but a Zip of the unity project will be made available for download.

The paddle was from the Unity Asset Store by "TheCloudCreator"
The base for the project was from https://github.com/mozilla/unity-webvr-export

The rest of the content outside of the prefabs and mozilla unity-webvr files are originals.
